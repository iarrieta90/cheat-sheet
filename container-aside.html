        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          The &lt;aside&gt; tag defines some content aside from the content it
          is placed in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aside content should be indirectly related to the surrounding
          content.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Tip:</strong>The &lt;aside&gt; content is often placed as a
          sidebar in a document.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Note: </strong>The &lt;aside&gt;element does not render as
          anything special in a browser. However, you can use CSS to style the
          &lt;aside&gt; element.
